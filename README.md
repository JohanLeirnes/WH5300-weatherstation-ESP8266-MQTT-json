# WH5300-weatherstation-ESP8266-MQTT-json
A ESP8266 based sniffer for the WH5300 weather station

Connect your GPIO14 to the Weatherstations receivers (the LCD-screen) DOUT pin and the GND pin to the receivers GND pin.
There are 3 pins on the device. I have marked out the GND pin and DOUT pin on the Receiver:
